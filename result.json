A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.", "author_details": null, "related_books": [], "ratings_info": {"total_ratings": "1,274,998", "total_reviews": ""}, "ratings_histogram": [{"rating": "5 stars", "count_percentage": "550,791 (43%)"}, {"rating": "4 stars", "count_percentage": "420,163 (32%)"}, {"rating": "3 stars", "count_percentage": "229,447 (17%)"}, {"rating": "2 stars", "count_percentage": "56,607 (4%)"}, {"rating": "1 star", "count_percentage": "17,990 (1%)"}]}]},
